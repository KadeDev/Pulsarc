## What is this?
This is a community project to create a new rhythm game that is inspired by the gameplay of Intralism.

## Why are you doing this?
It is clear that the Intralism team does not care for the game nearly as much as the community does. Despite promising change, the team does not work on the game at a rate fast enough to support the community it has. Instead of relying on inconsistent devs to make what we want, why don't we just make what we want instead?

## Sounds cool! How can I help out?
